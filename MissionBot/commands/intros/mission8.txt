Mission 8: Paper trail

There have been reports of underground markets gaining access to heavy water, a dangerous chemical deemed dangerous if misused.

We have been tasked with locating the supplier and infiltrating their supply chain.

To start, we have to identify said organization. We provide you with several receipts to locate the supplier.

Locate the organization supplying heavy water.

The Archive files are MCBW001, MCBW002, and MCBW003.

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be idling.
