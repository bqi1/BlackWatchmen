Mission 7: Leading to the nest

Our agents are in pursuit of a suspect in a major cultist group.

We had tracked her down to a bidding auction, but found noone.

We suspect that she gained word of our arrival and left hastily.

Our agents took multiple crime scene photos of any interesting objects they encountered, and stored them in the Archive.

We entrust you to find the full name of the cultist group the suspect belonged to prior to their disappearence.

The Archive files are ZMWL001 to ZMWL006.

Remember, some files may be unneccessary to complete the mission. Isolate the files that you find are for sure suspicious.

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be listening.
