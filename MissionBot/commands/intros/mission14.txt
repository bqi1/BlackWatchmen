Mission 14: Decrypting passages

We have received an encrypted message from an agent. He was to relay us a codeword.

This encryption uses the Vigenere Cipher. To decrypt the message, you need a keyphrase. The keyphrase has to make sense rather than a bunch of random characters. Keyphrases can range from being words to full blown sentences.

A useful tool is https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be relaxing.
