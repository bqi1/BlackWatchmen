Mission 12: Connecting the dots

There are 3 scientists in the institute, Rosenberg Clinic, that have been suspected of human experimentation.

Given their background checks, we would like you to single out a connection that any of them might have that connects to human experimentation.

The connection does not have to be shared amongst the scientists.

Send us the official name of the area of interest.

The Archive files are BBNI001, BBNI002, and BBNI003.

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be expecting.
