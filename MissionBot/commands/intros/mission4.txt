Mission 4: Uncovering their tracks

We had been tracking an incognito criminal organization specializing in chemical warfare.

Unfortunately, they cover their tracks well, and even our expansive network has had difficulty in tracing them down.

We intercepted an office believed to be holding remote data away from their base of operations.

We retrieved several files, and have them stored in the archives for inspection. We believe these may be used to pinpoint where they're conducting experiments.

Locate the city that the organization is conducting their chemical processing in.

The Archive files are JFNW129, SKWO103, and NWOR441.

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be waiting.
