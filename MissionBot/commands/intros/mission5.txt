Mission 5: Expanding your toolset

This mission focuses on understanding how your deciphering kit works, further than just plugging in letters and hoping for the best.

We intercepted a sequence of letters, in order, from an enemy spy.

We would like you to decipher the message the spy was attempting to convey.

The Archive files are IEN001, IEN002, IEN003, IEN004, IEN005, IEN006, and IEN007. 

For each image, the title is at the top, and the bottom is the body of the letter.

The message contains no spaces.

To help in understanding your kit, we recommend you look at the approved document as file HELP023 in the Archives.

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be expecting.
