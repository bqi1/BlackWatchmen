Mission 16: Unlimited Supply

A research facility linked to the Rosenberg clinic, named SuperTerram Life Sciences, is found to be dealing in human experimentation.

Specifically, we noticed an unusually high amount of bodies being supplied to them from an unknown source.

Our network intrusion team has retrieved 4 internal files from their network. Inspect them.

Find the source of the bodies.

The Archive file for the documents are MDIW001 to MDIW004

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be waiting.
