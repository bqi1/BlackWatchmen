Mission 6: An attempted breach

Our agents had been gathering incriminating evidence on an expert decrypter for illegal transactions up to the millions in CAD.

We had been storing them in our secure Archive file network.

A few days ago, the hacker attempted to delete all Archive files. We were forced in the dark for about 45 minutes until we could successfully block him out.

We believe that no files were tampered, and will proceed normally in our investigation.

We entrust the task of finding out his address to you. Once we have it, we can connect many more dots and convict him in court.

The Archive files detailing on his whereabouts are located at c2Fu001, ZHdp002, and Y2g=003.

Reminder: Archives are structured as <archive code><sequence number>

The format should be <street name> St & <road name> Rd. There should be no numbers.

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be observant.
