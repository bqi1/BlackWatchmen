Mission 2: Words speak louder than actions

We had sent 2 agents, Agent 33 and Agent 45, out as scouts to gather intel on a criminal organization, specifically on a major bank scandal.

They were to report back anything of interest.

Unfortunately, it was reported from Agent 45 that Agent 33 had been caught and killed by the organization.

Agent 45 had since then been relaying information for months to us when we received an unauthorized audio file from an unknown sender.

This was highly unusual since our network has an extremely difficult encryption to bypass.

Go to the Archives and request file LDOW925 to find the audio message that had been sent.

A useful decrypting tool would be https://www.asciitohex.com/

To help in understanding your kit, we recommend you look at the approved document as file HELP023 in the Archives.

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be watching.
