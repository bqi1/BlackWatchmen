Mission 11: Redacted

A target clinic of interest, named Rosenberg Clinic, is suspected of human experimentation.

We have secured a processed letter from them without their knowledge.

We would like you to find the redacted chemical in the letter.

The Archive file is RSON221.

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be waiting.
