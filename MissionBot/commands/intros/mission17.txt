Mission 17: Wolf in Sheep's Clothing

Recently, we have been made aware of a conspiracy happening inside a cereal company, dubbed Brain Branzo Flaks. The company cannot be traced online.

Their goal is to hack into a crypto market and siphon off major funds through their cereal mascot disguised VPN.

The cereal mascot is a piece of toast named Brian. Not that interesting.
