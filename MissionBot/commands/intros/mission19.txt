Mission 19: Crack the safe.

We recovered the agent's body in Cooper's cave. The coroners are performing the autopsy, but for now, a note was found in his jacket pocket. We believe it can be used to crack the safe found in his car.

Crack the combination. Additionally, the word Futhark was scrawled on the back of the note.

The files are BA8E2C1, 9BA82FA, and PEFM294.

Send us the 6 digit numerical combination.

Because he was a field agent, every tool he had on his person was necessary for his mission. Consider that when deciphering.

His location does not matter in this solution.

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be waiting.
