Mission 1: A hidden message

We had sent an agent on a mission to investigate a target of interest in Los Angeles.

He was provided with a falsified name, passport, and remained in covert for approximately 3 days.

We received a postcard under his alias detailing his status, and think it would be a fairly simple challenge for you to start decrypting with.

Go to the Archives and request file GXUA176 to find the message they wished to convey to us.

To retrieve an existing file from the archives, type !retrieve <filename>.

In this case, it would be !retrieve GXUA176

When you have the solution, send us the message. We'll be waiting.
