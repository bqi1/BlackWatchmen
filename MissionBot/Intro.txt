Welcome, recruit. In short, this is an organization specializing in cryptography and steganography.

Due to the covert nature of our organization, communication between HQ and our agents involves hiding messages in plain sight.

There are several challenges that you, a skilled individual, should be able to be complete.

Most of these puzzles should be fairly simple to complete, and may expand to using the internet. Analyze every minute detail.

There may be information unnecessary to the mission.

Best of luck fam.

A suggested tool is https://www.asciitohex.com/ to help with decryption. Try using it at any chance you get.

Every mission gives you the necessary intel to complete, and you must submit your answer here to verify if it's correct.

To access a mission, simply type !mission<#> start

To submit your solution for a mission, type !mission<#> <your solution>

For example, type !mission1 start.

You will alternate between DMing us and the Archives bot in the same server. The Archives bot contains all the data needed for specific missions.

Warning: If you find yourself looking at visually disturbing stuff, chances are you're on the wrong site.

Currently, there are 19 missions. Difficulty varies slightly per mission.
